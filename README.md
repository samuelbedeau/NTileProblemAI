# NTileProblemAI
This script is based upon the N Tile Puzzle problem in Artificial Intelligence which is part of the State Space topic.


The Sliding Tiles Puzzle was created by chess player and puzzle maker Sam Loyd (1841-1911) in the 1870s. The puzzle consists of a N x M, where each cell could be represented as a number, a letter, an image or basically anything you can think of.
The task in the sliding tiles puzzle is to rearrange the tiles of some starting state in a manner in which all of them end up arranged matching another configuration known as the goal state

To solve this issue, a state space representation will need to be created
